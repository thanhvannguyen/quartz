Testing out this new vault on [[Obsidian]] and will try to publish it somehow. 

2 hours later and many git comments, here I am. It is not as hard as I thought it would be. Instructions really help. 

A discussion with a friend today on the question on how the definition of 'culture' is subjective (I think this is obvious) but it varies so significantly from one person to the other. Some can be considred as 'social norm' while others think it's a cultural thing. A habit to queue up is 'culture'? How about the norm of traveling outside of the country every time school holiday starts? That can't be called '[[culture]]' can it? A way of thinking that being a host inviting somebody into our home means making sure the person gets the best treatment, that is closer to it being a culture. Is it a positive notion to associate something as 'cutural'? Did it start with 'nice-to-have' things of the past, like learning music, painting, poetry? But in the modern time it is not so much a distintion betwen being 'cultural' and not. Do we say 'being cultural' or 'doing something of culture'. I really am not sure where this is going for now. 

The interns came in this week. Today we had the welcome lunch with them. Wide-eyed young creatures who are fascinated by everything we do. It makes me feel old. They all seem like nice people. #work

Started reading [[Book: Rationality]] by [[Elizer Yudkowsky]], bought for [[kindle]]. It is not something to read or understand quickly, but it is fascinating to me to try to at least get something out of it, learn a way of thinking. It always helps to be more rational when I can.
