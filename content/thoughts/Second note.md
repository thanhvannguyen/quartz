Same day, which is today, May 24. 

A comment came today from a colleague who moved to a new office. She said she was given a reminder that she got used to how the environment is, slowly gave up on her commitment to changes, since making suggestions yielded no difference, nobody cared and nobody changed, she started to forget how bad she used to see things. Managers asked 'So what have you done so far?'. Tough question. It is not about being defensive, it is a reminder that yes many things could have been done, she could have taken an extra step to try that. 

Listening to this I feel for her. I can relate to this. I can see many many people around me doing the same thing. They give up after some  time once they realize things will not change as quickly as they thought it would. They lose hope and lose faith. I can see them being detached further from the rest of us. What takes to keep that faith for long enough to recognize things will take time but things are in our hands to influence. 

Today I made a comment to someone else 'it is part of "growing up" to do this', and the person responded 'I guess I am a child'.. No it was not what I meant. But maybe it was really what I meant. 

Time to sleep I guess..
